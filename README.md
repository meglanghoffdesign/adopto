## Description

​Adopto is an AI-powered pet matching platform designed to enhance the pet adoption experience for shelters, breeders, and adopters. By leveraging artificial intelligence, Adopto analyzes pet behavior, health, and adoption histories to predict successful matches between pets and potential adopters. This approach aims to reduce return rates and expedite the adoption process. For adopters, Adopto offers personalized pet care advice, training tips, and health alerts to ensure a smooth transition and ongoing support. Shelters and breeders benefit from AI-driven adoption analytics, aiding in optimizing future placements. The platform also plans to integrate veterinary partnerships and enhance donation transparency to further support pet welfare.
